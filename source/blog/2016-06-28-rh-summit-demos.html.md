If you're at Red Hat Summit, you might want to come by the Atomic Pod in Community Central and see the [Sub-Atomic Cluster](). More usefully, we'll be having a series of live demos by various contributors to the Atomic suite of projects, including:

* Tuesday, 12:45pm: Using Cockpit to manage Kubernetes and Registry
* Wednesday, 12:15pm: Container Security Tools
* Thursday, 11:00am: Building Multi-container Apps

The Atomic Pod is in Community Central on the main expo floor, right next to the OpenShift Corner.

We will be attempting to schedule additional demonstrations as folks become available, so check back on this page for more.
