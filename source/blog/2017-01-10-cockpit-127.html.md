Show security scan information about container images
-----------------------------------------------------

Lars did work to show security scan information about container images.
The displayed scans happen via the [atomic scan](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/05/02/introducing-atomic-scan-container-vulnerability-detection/)
tools and the data
comes from the [OpenSCAP](https://www.open-scap.org/) system. Take a look at the video below.

Choose whether password is cached and reused on the login screen
----------------------------------------------------------------

The typical workflow for peforming privileged tasks on a Linux system is
to log in as a non-root user and then use sudo or Polkit to escalate
privileges.

Stef did work to make Cockpit's privilege escalation reflect this
properly. Cockpit now has an option on the login screen to
"Reuse my password for privileged tasks". Checking this option
automatically performs reuses the login password as necessary to
escalate privileges. If you leave this box unchecked then Cockpit will
behave exactly as a normal user login without special privileges.

In the future we'll have a way to enable this option once logged in, and
retype your password inside of the logged in session.

The remotectl command can now combine certificate and key files
---------------------------------------------------------------

Peter did work to make it easier to use TLS certificate and key files
with Cockpit for port 9090. Normally the server certificate(s) and key
need to be combined into a single file and placed into the
/etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d directory. The remotectl command that comes with
Cockpit can now be used to build such a combined file.

Due to this, when Cockpit is deployed as an Openshift Pod it can use
certificates provided by Openshift.

Cockpit respects /etc/shells
----------------------------

Martin fixed Cockpit so it only allows the user to log in if the user
has a valid shell listed in /etc/shells. In addition bugs on Ubuntu and
Debian have been fixed where users were created without valid shells.

Allow renaming of active devices in networking interface
--------------------------------------------------------

You can now rename network devices like bonds or bridges while they're
active. The change will apply immediately and without any interruption
in service.

[Change](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/5570)


Rename cockpit-shell to cockpit-system
--------------------------------------

The cockpit-shell subpackage has been renamed to cockpit-system to
better reflect its focus: configuring and troubleshooting the local system.

[Change](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/5600)


Kerberos authentication now works even if gss-proxy is in use
------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes Kerberos (or GSSAPI) single-sign-on authentication requires
multiple round trips to the server. Cockpit now supports this properly,
and the end result is that SSO works even when fancy things like
GSS-Proxy are in use.
