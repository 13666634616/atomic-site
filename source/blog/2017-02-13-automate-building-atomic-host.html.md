[Project Atomic](http://www.projectatomic.io/) hosts are built from standard RPM packages which have been composed into filesystem trees using rpm-ostree. This guide provides method for automation of Building Atomic host(Creating new trees).

One of the primary benefits to Atomic Host and OSTree has been the ability to "configure once, deploy many times" using custom OSTree images. But the process for doing so wasn't streamlined or well-documented. I'm helping change that. I'm going to describe how to build atomic host in automated way. At the end of the article you'll be able to create VM from QCOW2 image which is going to boot in to the own OSTree and the VM can also be used for testing Atomic host, please feel free to open issue in that case: [https://pagure.io/atomic-wg/issues](https://pagure.io/atomic-wg/issues).

The procedure and playbook below will enable you to create your own Atomic Host OSTree image. This is the first step in creating your own "distributions" of Atomic Host to install on your cloud servers. Note that it will install a bunch of requirements on your local server, as well as using system resources heavily. As such, you may want to run it on a development machine instead of your personal laptop.

There is also Documentation on Project Atomic which describes about Compose own Tree and Build Atomic host: [http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/compose-your-own-tree](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/compose-your-own-tree/).


# Requirements
* Fedora Atomic QCOW2 Image. The image can be downloaded from here: [Fedora-Atomic](https://getfedora.org/en/atomic/download/)
* Make sure that Ansible is installed on your system: Note that I am installing on my [Fedora-Workstation](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/download).

```
$ sudo dnf install ansible python2-dnf
```


## Process
Clone the Git repo on your working machine [Build-Atomic-Host](https://github.com/trishnaguha/build-atomic-host/)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/trishnaguha/build-atomic-host.git
$ cd build-atomic-host
```


## Create VM from the QCOW2 Image
The following creates VM from QCOW2 Image where username is `atomic-user` and password is `atomic`.
Here `atomic-node` in the instance name.

```
$ sudo sh create-vm.sh atomic-node /path/to/fedora-atomic25.qcow2
# For example: /var/lib/libvirt/images/Fedora-Atomic-25-20170131.0.x86_64.qcow2
```


## Install Requirements and Start HTTP Server
The tree is made available via web server. The following playbook installs requirements, creates directory structure, initializes OSTree repository and starts the HTTP server on TCP Port 35000.

```
$ ansible-playbook setup.yml --ask-sudo-pass
```


Use `ip addr` to check IP Address of the HTTP server.

```
$ ip addr
7: virbr0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:37:7f:e9 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.122.1/24 brd 192.168.122.255 scope global virbr0
```
This is how it looks like when you check for the IP Address of the running HTTP Server with the above command.
According to the output IP Address of the running HTTP server is `192.168.122.1`.


## Give OSTree a name and add HTTP Server IP Address

Replace the variables given in [vars/atomic.yml](https://github.com/trishnaguha/build-atomic-host/tree/master/vars/atomic.yml) with OSTree name and HTTP Server IP Address.
For Instance:

```
# Variables for Atomic host
atomicname: my-atomic
httpserver: 192.168.122.1
```
Here `my-atomic` is OSTree name and `192.168.122.1` is HTTP Server IP Address.


## Run All-in-one Playbook
The following playbook composes OSTree, performs SSH-setup and rebases on created Tree.

```
$ ansible-playbook main.yml --ask-sudo-pass
```


## Check IP Address of the Atomic instance
The following command returns the IP Address of the running Atomic instance

```
$ sudo virsh domifaddr atomic-node
```


## Reboot
Now SSH to the Atomic Host and reboot it so that it can reboot in to the created OSTree:

```
$ ssh atomic-user@<atomic-hostIP>
$ sudo systemctl reboot
```

Wait for few minutes after the reboot so that you do not get connection refused by the host while SSH-ing.


## Verify: SSH to the Atomic Host

```
$ ssh atomic-user@192.168.122.221
[atomic-user@atomic-node ~]$ sudo rpm-ostree status
State: idle
Deployments:
‚óè my-atomic:fedora-atomic/25/x86_64/docker-host
       Version: 25.1 (2017-02-07 05:34:46)

```

Now you have the Updated Tree.

If you are willing to Compose your own tree which includes addition or deletion of packages of your own choice, Please follow [Compose-your-own-tree](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/compose-your-own-tree/) by [Jason Brooks](https://twitter.com/jasonbrooks).
