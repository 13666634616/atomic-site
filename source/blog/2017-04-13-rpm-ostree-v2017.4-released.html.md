[rpm-ostree](https://rpm-ostree.readthedocs.org/) is the
hybrid image/package system that provides transactional
upgrades on Atomic Host. Here are some highlights from
version v2017.4, as well as from earlier versions this year.

### Deployment operations are now cumulative

Previously, if you wanted to both install a package and
upgrade, you would have to do:

```
# rpm-ostree upgrade
# reboot
# rpm-ostree install foo
# reboot
```

Not very efficient. This was changed in v2017.2 so that
operations became cumulative, thus only requiring one
reboot:

```
# rpm-ostree upgrade
# rpm-ostree install foo
# reboot
```

This is much better, but it's still causing rpm-ostree to
create an intermediate deployment that soon after gets
overwritten. In v2017.4, we can finally do these operations
in a single step:

```
# rpm-ostree upgrade --install foo
# reboot
```

Of course, the same `--install` and `--uninstall` switches
are available on the `deploy` and `rebase` commands.

There is work underway to further improve on this and
directly update the booted deployment, so that rebooting is
no longer needed.

### RPMs can now be directly installed

Previously, if you wanted to overlay a specific RPM file,
you'd have to shove it into a repo and place that repo in
`/etc/yum.repos.d`. With v2017.4, rpm-ostree is now able to
install it directly:

```
# rpm-ostree install ltrace.rpm
# rpm-ostree status
State: idle
Deployments:
  fedora-atomic:fedora-atomic/25/x86_64/docker-host
             Version: 25.89 (2017-03-26 21:04:50)
          BaseCommit: 6a71adb06bc296c19839e951c38dc0b71ee5d7a82262fef9612f256f0c2a70da
              OSName: fedora-atomic
       LocalPackages: ltrace-0.7.91-20.fc25.x86_64

* fedora-atomic:fedora-atomic/25/x86_64/docker-host
             Version: 25.89 (2017-03-26 21:04:50)
          BaseCommit: 6a71adb06bc296c19839e951c38dc0b71ee5d7a82262fef9612f256f0c2a70da
              OSName: fedora-atomic
```

As you can see above, the package shows up in a new
`LocalPackages`.  This is different from `LayeredPackages`:
packages in the latter are updated as new deployments are
created, whereas those in the former are *never* updated. So
in the example above, `ltrace` will remain at that version.

You can always "unstick" a local package and fetch it back
from the repos:

```
# rpm-ostree uninstall ltrace-0.7.91-20.fc25.x86_64 --install ltrace
# rpm-ostree status
State: idle
Deployments:
  fedora-atomic:fedora-atomic/25/x86_64/docker-host
             Version: 25.89 (2017-03-26 21:04:50)
          BaseCommit: 6a71adb06bc296c19839e951c38dc0b71ee5d7a82262fef9612f256f0c2a70da
              OSName: fedora-atomic
     LayeredPackages: ltrace

* fedora-atomic:fedora-atomic/25/x86_64/docker-host
             Version: 25.89 (2017-03-26 21:04:50)
          BaseCommit: 6a71adb06bc296c19839e951c38dc0b71ee5d7a82262fef9612f256f0c2a70da
              OSName: fedora-atomic
       LocalPackages: ltrace-0.7.91-20.fc25.x86_64
```

### Configuration can now be reloaded (v2017.3)

Previously, one had to restart the `rpm-ostreed` service to
get it to notice new remotes or repo configuration changes.
Starting from v2017.3, there is now a `rpm-ostree reload`
command available to do this. System administrators might
prefer to use the equivalent `systemctl reload rpm-ostreed`.

### More powerful package layering semantics (v2017.3)

rpm-ostree is now much smarter about how it handles layered
RPMs. Previously, one couldn't add a package that already
existed in the base layer. Additionally, previously layered
packages would magically disappear if an update added that
same package. If another update subsequently removed that
package again, you'd be left without it layered at all.

Starting in v2017.3, rpm-ostree treats layered packages in a
more declarative manner; packages requested through the
`install` command are interpreted as directives to ensure
they are always present. They will then be layered only when
needed (i.e. when the base layer does not already contain
it).

Suppose you're on an ostree branch which has `strace` but
doesn't have `ltrace`:

```
# rpm-ostree status
State: idle
Deployments:
* branch/without/ltrace
           Timestamp: 2017-04-13 23:56:48
              Commit: 5745788c0e6c07bed73864b6addd4823961dbedd086c443e0ca50e13195e3da6
              OSName: fedora-atomic
# rpm -q strace ltrace
strace-4.16-1.fc25.x86_64
package ltrace is not installed
```

Imagine now that we want to make sure that `strace` and
`ltrace` are *always* installed:

```
# rpm-ostree install strace ltrace
# reboot
# rpm-ostree status
State: idle
Deployments:
* branch/without/ltrace
           Timestamp: 2017-04-14 00:09:45
              Commit: 5b338d0237a343201d6b277b58010241974e213b813aeb5d9f6923a1c46c86e4
              OSName: fedora-atomic
   RequestedPackages: strace
     LayeredPackages: ltrace

  branch/without/ltrace
           Timestamp: 2017-04-13 23:56:48
              Commit: 5745788c0e6c07bed73864b6addd4823961dbedd086c443e0ca50e13195e3da6
              OSName: fedora-atomic
# rpm -q ltrace
ltrace-0.7.91-20.fc25.x86_64
```

The output now becomes interesting. rpm-ostree determined
that out of `strace` and `ltrace`, only `ltrace` actually
needs to be layered. This is represented by the
`LayeredPackages` line above. However, it makes sure to
remember that the user always wants `strace` layered. This
is represented by the `RequestedPackages` line.

Imagine now that we rebase onto a different branch which
already has `ltrace` installed:

```
# rpm-ostree rebase branch/with/ltrace
# reboot
# rpm-ostree status
State: idle
Deployments:
* branch/with/ltrace
           Timestamp: 2017-04-13 23:56:23
              Commit: f345e110dbdff66630fbbd554adbc5d998e7f380c539c640393eaf3a99ccce61
              OSName: fedora-atomic
   RequestedPackages: ltrace strace

  branch/without/ltrace
           Timestamp: 2017-04-14 00:15:33
          BaseCommit: 5745788c0e6c07bed73864b6addd4823961dbedd086c443e0ca50e13195e3da6
              Commit: 84438e8ca1e7cf9266c89dfbde40cbe4119886aae4fb67ac53540d0d901a8cdc
              OSName: fedora-atomic
   RequestedPackages: strace
     LayeredPackages: ltrace
```

As expected, rpm-ostree has correctly determined that
`ltrace` no longer needs to be layered.

These features will be especially useful for Kubernetes
users on Fedora Atomic Host 25.
[The plan](http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2016/12/Kubernetes-returns-to-fedora-atomic/)
is to remove the `kubernetes` package in Fedora 26 from the
host in favour of a containerized install. Migration guides
will be available, though one will be able to keep it in the
host by explicitly requesting it prior to rebasing to Fedora
26:

```
# rpm-ostree install kubernetes
# rpm-ostree status
State: idle
Deployments:
  branch/with/ltrace
           Timestamp: 2017-04-13 23:56:23
              Commit: f345e110dbdff66630fbbd554adbc5d998e7f380c539c640393eaf3a99ccce61
              OSName: fedora-atomic
   RequestedPackages: kubernetes ltrace strace

* branch/with/ltrace
           Timestamp: 2017-04-13 23:56:23
              Commit: f345e110dbdff66630fbbd554adbc5d998e7f380c539c640393eaf3a99ccce61
              OSName: fedora-atomic
   RequestedPackages: ltrace strace
```

### Cleaning up deployments (v2017.2)

It was always possible to delete non-booted deployments by
dropping down to the ostree command `admin undeploy`. Though
as the feature set of rpm-ostree grows, it becomes important
to make sure that all proper layers and caches are cleaned
up.

In v2017.2, rpm-ostree learned the `cleanup` command to do
this. It's capable of deleting deployments pending
deployment (using `rpm-ostree cleanup --pending`), as well
as rollback deployment (using `rpm-ostree cleanup
--rollback`).

### Local initramfs regeneration (v2017.1)

By default, rpm-ostree sets up the bootloader so that the
initramfs from the content provider is used. However, there
are situations where one has host-specific requirements. A
typical example is ensuring that certain kernel modules are
included.

Starting from v2017.1, rpm-ostree learned the `initramfs`
command, which enables causes the initramfs to be
regenerated locally. One can also pass specific arguments to
dracut:

```
# rpm-ostree initramfs --enable --arg "--drivers" --arg "kmodule"
```
