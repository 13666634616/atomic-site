[rpm-ostree](https://rpm-ostree.readthedocs.org/) is the
hybrid image/package system that provides transactional
upgrades on Atomic Host. Here are some highlights from
version
[v2017.5](https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/releases/tag/v2017.5).

READMORE

This is a short release with mostly bugfixes, though there
are some small visible changes. You can test it out by
[rebasing your Fedora Atomic Host](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing#Using_it_with_Atomic_Host_.28Fedora_24_and_later.29)
onto the testing branch. Feel free to also leave karma in
the pending Bodhi updates:

- [Fedora 25 update](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2017-2fa9ff86ba)
- [Fedora 26 update](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2017-c5b64407b6)

### More terse status output by default

In v2017.4, we slightly changed the output of the `status`
command so that the `Commit` line was hidden when packages
are layered:

```
# rpm-ostree status
State: idle
Deployments:
* fedora-atomic:fedora-atomic/25/x86_64/docker-host
             Version: 25.113 (2017-04-25 01:47:29)
          BaseCommit: 3492546bc1ef6bca1bc7801ed6bb0414f90cc96668e067996dba3dee0d83e6c3
              OSName: fedora-atomic
     LayeredPackages: ltrace
```

The rationale is that the `Commit` line in this context is
specific to this host and has much less value than the
`BaseCommit`, which is the actual ostree commit published by
Fedora.

In v2017.5, the `OSName` line is also no longer printed by
default. Essentially, for the great majority of Atomic Host
users, it is superfluous information. You can read more
about this change
[here](https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/pull/743).

However, the `status` command did learn a `--verbose` switch
to force it to print both the `Commit` and the `OSName`
(which was renamed to `StateRoot`):

```
# rpm-ostree status
State: idle
Deployments:
* jlebon:fedora-atomic/25/x86_64/docker-host
             Version: 25.113.modified (2017-04-25 01:47:29)
          BaseCommit: 3492546bc1ef6bca1bc7801ed6bb0414f90cc96668e067996dba3dee0d83e6c3
     LayeredPackages: ltrace
