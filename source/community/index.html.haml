  Quick Start Guide

%p Now that you got Project Atomic installed, it's time to put it to work. And we have to write this quickstart guide so you can follow it. Basically the purpose of this section is to get your newly installed Atomic controller to do something useful and to make you understand how it works, how to install containers and how to do common deployments.
