    Project Atomic provides a bare-bones minimal OS that is designed to host containers 
    effectively and with minimum overhead. We provide atomic updates, so you can rely 
    on running a tested and tried software distribution underneath.

    Cloud images are available for download, supporting VirtualBox, QEMU/KVM and OpenStack. Support for
    bare metal installation is coming.

      %p.lead
        While Atomic Controller is a slimmed down
        system designed to run Docker containers, it derives from
        the upstream Red Hat Enterprise Linux RPMs.  It will closely
        track any errata in the RPMs, while still providing clients
        with fully atomic upgrades.

      %h2.featurette-heading Compatible filesystem layout, with writable /etc
      %p.lead
        Many "image" based operating system upgrade
        tools take the simple model of having state in a separate
        partition.  This interacts poorly with the traditional Unix
        of
        = succeed "." do
          %tt /etc
          With the OSTree base, configuration
          management tools like Puppet can write to
          %tt /etc
          as
          they always have, while still allowing atomic upgrades.

        %h2.featurette-heading SELinux in enforcing mode
        %p.lead
          Because the underlying rpm-ostree technology
          is an evolution of Fedora and RPM, Controller takes
          advantage of all of the work that's been put into things
          like Security-Enhanced Linux.  This allows it to confine
          Docker containers with strong mandatory access control.

        %h2.featurette-heading Extensible by privileged containers
        %p.lead
          You can extend Atomic Controller with additional software
          such as monitoring agents by creating privileged containers
          which can access the host system.
